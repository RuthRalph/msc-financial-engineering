## Section 1: Time Value of Money

### Question 1.1 (★)
You have the option to receive $5,000 today or $5,500 in one year. If you can invest money at an annual rate of 8%, which option should you choose?

**Solution:**
- Option 1: Receive $5,000 today
  - Future value in 1 year: FV = $5,000 × (1 + 0.08) = $5,400
- Option 2: Receive $5,500 in one year
  - Present value today: PV = $5,500 / (1 + 0.08) = $5,092.59

**Answer**: Choose Option 2 ($5,500 in one year) because:
- The present value of $5,500 is $5,092.59, which is more than $5,000
- Alternatively, $5,000 today would only grow to $5,400, which is less than $5,500

### Question 1.2 (★★)
A company offers you two payment options for a project:
- Option A: $10,000 today, $10,000 in 1 year, $10,000 in 2 years
- Option B: $5,000 today, $15,000 in 1 year, $10,000 in 2 years

If the discount rate is 6%, which option has a higher present value?

**Solution:**
Calculate present value of each option:

**Option A:**
- PV = $10,000 + $10,000/(1.06) + $10,000/(1.06)²
- PV = $10,000 + $9,433.96 + $8,899.96
- PV = $28,333.92

**Option B:**
- PV = $5,000 + $15,000/(1.06) + $10,000/(1.06)²
- PV = $5,000 + $14,150.94 + $8,899.96
- PV = $28,050.90

**Answer**: Option A has a higher present value ($28,333.92 vs $28,050.90)

## Section 2: Simple vs Compound Interest

### Question 2.1 (★)
You invest $20,000 at a 4% annual interest rate for 5 years. Calculate the future value using:
a) Simple interest
b) Compound interest

**Solution:**

**a) Simple Interest:**
- FV = P(1 + rt) = $20,000(1 + 0.04 × 5)
- FV = $20,000 × 1.20 = $24,000
- Interest earned = $4,000

**b) Compound Interest:**
- FV = P(1 + r)^t = $20,000(1 + 0.04)^5
- FV = $20,000 × 1.21665 = $24,333.06
- Interest earned = $4,333.06

**Answer**: 
- Simple interest: $24,000
- Compound interest: $24,333.06
- Difference: $333.06 (compound interest earns more due to interest on interest)

### Question 2.2 (★★)
Bank A offers 5% simple interest, while Bank B offers 4.5% compound interest. You plan to invest $50,000 for 8 years. Which bank should you choose?

**Solution:**

**Bank A (Simple Interest):**
- FV = $50,000(1 + 0.05 × 8) = $50,000 × 1.40 = $70,000

**Bank B (Compound Interest):**
- FV = $50,000(1 + 0.045)^8 = $50,000 × 1.4221 = $71,105

**Answer**: Choose Bank B. Despite the lower rate, compound interest yields $71,105 vs $70,000, a difference of $1,105.

---

### Question 2.3 (★★★)
You borrow $15,000 and agree to pay it back in 3 years. The lender offers you two options:
- Option 1: 6% simple interest
- Option 2: 5.5% compound interest

Which option should you choose as a borrower?

**Solution:**

**Option 1 (Simple Interest):**
- FV = $15,000(1 + 0.06 × 3) = $15,000 × 1.18 = $17,700
- Total interest = $2,700

**Option 2 (Compound Interest):**
- FV = $15,000(1 + 0.055)^3 = $15,000 × 1.1742 = $17,613
- Total interest = $2,613

**Answer**: Choose Option 2 (compound interest). As a borrower, you want to pay less, so the lower compound interest rate results in $87 less to repay.

**Solution:**
- Nominal rate = 5% = 0.05
- Compounding frequency = 12 (monthly)
- EAR = (1 + r/n)^n - 1
- EAR = (1 + 0.05/12)^12 - 1
- EAR = (1.004167)^12 - 1
- EAR = 1.05116 - 1
- EAR = 0.05116 = 5.116%

**Answer**: Effective annual rate is 5.116%

---

### Question 4.2 (★★)
You deposit $10,000 at a bank that pays 4.8% annual interest compounded quarterly. How much will you have after 3 years?

**Solution:**
- P = $10,000
- r = 0.048 (annual rate)
- n = 4 (quarterly compounding)
- t = 3 years
- FV = P(1 + r/n)^(n×t)
- FV = $10,000(1 + 0.048/4)^(4×3)
- FV = $10,000(1.012)^12
- FV = $10,000 × 1.1539
- FV = $11,539

**Answer**: $11,539

---

### Question 4.3 (★★★)
Bank A offers 5% compounded monthly, while Bank B offers 5.1% compounded quarterly. You plan to invest $20,000 for 5 years. Which bank should you choose?

**Solution:**

**Bank A (5% monthly):**
- FV = $20,000(1 + 0.05/12)^(12×5)
- FV = $20,000(1.004167)^60
- FV = $20,000 × 1.2834
- FV = $25,668

**Bank B (5.1% quarterly):**
- FV = $20,000(1 + 0.051/4)^(4×5)
- FV = $20,000(1.01275)^20
- FV = $20,000 × 1.2892
- FV = $25,784

**Answer**: Choose Bank B. Despite lower nominal rate, quarterly compounding at 5.1% yields $25,784 vs $25,668, a difference of $116.

---

### Question 4.4 (★★★)
Convert a 6% annual rate compounded monthly to an equivalent annual rate compounded quarterly.

**Solution:**
- r₁ = 0.06, m₁ = 12 (monthly)
- m₂ = 4 (quarterly)
- We need to find r₂

Using: (1 + r₁/m₁)^(m₁) = (1 + r₂/m₂)^(m₂)

- (1 + 0.06/12)^12 = (1 + r₂/4)^4
- (1.005)^12 = (1 + r₂/4)^4
- 1.06168 = (1 + r₂/4)^4
- (1.06168)^(1/4) = 1 + r₂/4
- 1.0151 = 1 + r₂/4
- r₂/4 = 0.0151

## Section 7: Nominal vs Real Interest Rates

### Question 7.1 (★)
You earn 5% on your savings account, and inflation is 2%. What is your real interest rate?

**Solution (Approximate):**
- Real rate ≈ Nominal rate - Inflation rate
- Real rate ≈ 5% - 2% = 3%

**Solution (Exact):**
- r_real = (1 + r_nominal) / (1 + π) - 1
- r_real = (1.05) / (1.02) - 1
- r_real = 1.0294 - 1
- r_real = 0.0294 = 2.94%

**Answer**: Real interest rate is approximately 3% (exact: 2.94%)

---

### Question 7.2 (★★)
You invest $10,000 at 6% nominal interest for 1 year. If inflation is 3.5%, what is your real return in dollars?

**Solution:**
- Nominal return: $10,000 × 0.06 = $600
- Future value: $10,600
- Real rate = (1.06)/(1.035) - 1 = 0.0242 = 2.42%
- Real return: $10,000 × 0.0242 = $242

**Alternative calculation:**
- Real purchasing power = $10,600 / 1.035 = $10,241.55
- Real return = $10,241.55 - $10,000 = $241.55 ≈ $242

**Answer**: Real return is approximately $242

---

### Question 7.3 (★★★)
In a high-inflation environment, you earn 12% on an investment, but inflation is 10%. 
a) What is your real interest rate?
b) If you invested $50,000, what is the real value of your investment after 1 year?

**Solution:**

**a) Real Interest Rate:**
- r_real = (1.12)/(1.10) - 1
- r_real = 1.0182 - 1
- r_real = 0.0182 = 1.82%

**b) Real Value:**
- Nominal value after 1 year: $50,000 × 1.12 = $56,000
- Real value: $56,000 / 1.10 = $50,909.09
- Real gain: $50,909.09 - $50,000 = $909.09

**Answer**:
- a) Real interest rate is 1.82% (much lower than the 12% nominal rate)
- b) Real value is $50,909.09, a real gain of only $909.09

## Section 8: Applied Problems - Retirement Planning

### Question 8.1 (★★)
Sarah is 30 years old and wants to retire at 65 with $1,000,000 in today's dollars. She believes inflation will average 3% and can earn 7% on investments. How much should she save annually (at year-end) from age 30 to 64?

**Solution:**

**Step 1: Calculate future value needed in 35 years**
- FV_target = $1,000,000 × (1.03)^35
- FV_target = $1,000,000 × 2.8139
- FV_target = $2,813,900

**Step 2: Calculate annual payment needed**
- Using annuity formula: FV = PMT × [(1 + r)^n - 1] / r
- $2,813,900 = PMT × [(1.07)^35 - 1] / 0.07
- $2,813,900 = PMT × [10.6766 - 1] / 0.07
- $2,813,900 = PMT × 138.237
- PMT = $2,813,900 / 138.237
- PMT = $20,350.50

**Answer**: Sarah needs to save approximately $20,351 per year

### Question 8.2 (★★★)
John is 25 and plans to retire at 60. He wants to withdraw $80,000 per year (in today's dollars) for 25 years during retirement. He can earn 6% on investments and expects 2.5% inflation. How much should he save annually from age 25 to 59?

**Solution:**

This is a complex problem requiring multiple steps. We'll use a spreadsheet approach conceptually:

**Step 1: Calculate retirement needs in future dollars**
- First withdrawal at age 60: $80,000 × (1.025)^35 = $187,500
- Need to calculate present value of 25-year annuity at retirement

**Step 2: Calculate PV of retirement withdrawals at age 60**
- Using annuity formula with inflation-adjusted withdrawals
- This requires calculating the present value of a growing annuity

**Step 3: Calculate annual savings needed**
- Work backwards from the amount needed at age 60
- Use annuity future value formula

**Simplified Approach:**
- Target at retirement (age 60): Need PV of $80,000 growing at 2.5% for 25 years, discounted at 6%
- This is approximately $1,200,000 in today's dollars
- Future value needed: $1,200,000 × (1.025)^35 = $2,812,500
- Annual savings (35 years): $2,812,500 / FV annuity factor
- FV annuity factor (35 years, 6%): [(1.06)^35 - 1] / 0.06 = 111.43
- Annual savings: $2,812,500 / 111.43 = $25,240

**Answer**: Approximately $25,240 per year (exact calculation would require spreadsheet)
