## Customization

### Adding New Courses

Edit `web-interface/app.js` and add to the `courseStructure` object:

```javascript
const courseStructure = {
    "01-financial-markets": { ... },
    "02-financial-data": {
        title: "Course 2: Financial Data",
        duration: "7 weeks",
        modules: { ... }
    }
};
```

### Styling

Modify `web-interface/styles.css` to customize:
- Colors (CSS variables in `:root`)
- Fonts
- Spacing
- Layout

## Browser Support

- Chrome/Edge (recommended)
- Firefox
- Safari
- Any modern browser with ES6 support

## Notes

- The interface requires a local web server to load markdown files (CORS restrictions)
- Markdown rendering is simplified - for full markdown support, consider integrating a library like `marked` or `markdown-it`
- Progress tracking is a placeholder - can be enhanced with localStorage

## Troubleshooting

**Files not loading?**
- Make sure you're running a local web server
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify file paths are correct

**Styling looks off?**
- Clear browser cache
- Check that `styles.css` is loading (Network tab)

**Navigation not working?**
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Ensure `app.js` is loading correctly

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Full markdown rendering with syntax highlighting
- [ ] Search functionality
- [ ] Progress tracking with localStorage
- [ ] Bookmarking/favorites
- [ ] Note-taking integration
- [ ] Export to PDF
- [ ] Mobile app version
