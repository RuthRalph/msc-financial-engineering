## Repository Structure

Each course folder contains:
- `notes/` - Lecture notes and study materials
- `assignments/` - Course assignments and solutions
- `projects/` - Applied projects and exercises
- `code/` - Python scripts and implementations
- `resources/` - Additional reading materials and references

Additional folders:
- `linkedin-posts/` - LinkedIn posts for learning in public
- `templates/` - Reusable templates for notes, assignments, projects
- `resources/` - Shared resources across courses

## Getting Started

### Quick Start - Web Interface (Recommended)

View your study materials in a beautiful web interface:

```bash
# Start the web server (no installation needed!)
npx serve -p 8000

# Or use Python
python3 -m http.server 8000

# Or use the script
./start-server.sh
```

Then open: http://localhost:8000

### For Development Work

When you start doing Python assignments and projects:

1. See `setup.md` for Python environment setup
2. Navigate to the specific course folder you're working on
3. Review the course-specific README for detailed information
4. Follow the weekly structure within each course

## Notes

- All code should be written in Python/TypeScript
- Focus on applied learning and hands-on projects
- Maintain clear documentation for all work
- Collaborate effectively on group assignments
