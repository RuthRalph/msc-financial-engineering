# Intro to Module 1

Welcome to the first module of Financial Markets. In this module, we will dive into two important concepts: credit risk and financing.

To understand credit risk, let's consider a situation where somebody deposits money in a bank. A depositor saves money with an institution such as a bank or a credit union. That's not important. However, the depositor expects to receive periodic interest and ultimately the principal back, at some future time depending on where and when he or she needs the money. During the time, the depositor wants to ensure that his or her funds are safe. Even if the holding institution should experience a default and lose those funds, this is what we refer to as credit risk.

If we were the bank, the bank uses part of the depositor money and lends that money out to some borrower. The lender expects to receive interest and ultimately the principal back. So, likewise the lender wants to ensure that the borrower is good for both the interest and the principle, and this is again an instance of credit risk. In other words, we can say that every time someone else owes you future payments or principal amounts, then we have credit risk.

When it comes to financing, we all understand the basics of it. Somebody borrows money from someone and financing plays an important role in our society and economic development.

There is an even more extreme example when somebody borrows to sell short. In this case an investor is able to borrow a security he or she does not have, sell it and he or she then hopes that the price goes down before they have to buy it back. Regardless of how the price moves in the future, the investor will have to buy back the security in return that to the original owner. So, the cost of borrowing is known as financing. But, from the point of view of the original owner, he or she would like to make sure that the borrower will be able to make both the interest payments and return the principle. In other words, they don't want them to sell their shares around to Brazil or to any other country with that money.

Hopefully this all sounds very interesting and you'll be eager to dive into the required readings and the lesson notes. And don't forget to participate in the forums discussion and attend the live session. Let's begin!
